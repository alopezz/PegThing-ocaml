# Peg Thing - Ocaml

A toy program as an exercise to get familiar with Ocaml. Based by
following the example from the _Clojure for the Brave and True_ book
available
[here](https://www.braveclojure.com/functional-programming/).

The project uses _dune_ to manage the build:

- `dune build` to build everything.
- `dune exec bin/main.exe` to start the game.
- `dune runtest` to run the tests (written using _ounit2_).
